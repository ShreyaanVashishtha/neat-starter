## Lists

Unordered

* Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
* Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:

  * Marker character change forces new list start:

    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    * Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
* Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit

Start numbering with offset:
